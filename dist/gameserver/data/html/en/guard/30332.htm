Captain Bathis:
Welcome, young traveler. I am Captain Bathis, commander of the guards responsible for the security of this village and its vicinity. Do you see *Castle Gludio* across the bridge? When I look upon that magnificent castle where my Lord resides, I am struck with reverence and pride.

You must excuse me, young one, but may I offer a word of advice? What is it that you are wearing? Fashion is all very well, but... I do not think armor should be worn for style. Even if it's not exactly flattering, you really need something stronger! Tsk tsk... Young ones...

[npc_%objectId%_Chat 1|Ask about Castle Gludio.]
