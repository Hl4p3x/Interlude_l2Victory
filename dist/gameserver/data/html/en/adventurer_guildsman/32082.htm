Well, well, well!

The Lord finally defeated the raid boss, huh?

That must've been a hell-of-a show!

I wish I'd seen that!

I had to come and see for myself when I heard the news!

Surely you've heard that our guild is collecting Life Crystals?!

Bring some and I'll make a splendind, unique item for you!
