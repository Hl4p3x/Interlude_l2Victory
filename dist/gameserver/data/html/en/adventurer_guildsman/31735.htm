!Adventure Guild Member:

This world seethes with violence and corruption!

Though Einhasad teaches peace and healing and Eva extolls nature and harmony, no brave person has stepped forward to lead our people out of this bloody darkness...

Perhaps someone like you can galvanize the resistance!

I have in my possession personal messages from some who desperately need your help!

Will you hear their plea?
