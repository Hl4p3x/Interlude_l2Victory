At first glance Zaken seems invincible, <font color="LEVEL">but perhaps I have spotted a chink in his armor.</font> As dawn broke over the ragged remains of my party, I noticed that <font color="LEVEL">Zaken's recovery rate noticeably dropped.</font>

Could it be that his awesome power is only available to him at night? If somehow I can survive the coming darkness, I might defeat him yet!

<font color="LEVEL">But, however I look at it, my chances are not good.</font> I'm almost certainly done for!

Whoever reads this, avenge my death and the deaths of my comrades!
