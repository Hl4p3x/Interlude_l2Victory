Research Log:

Period 3 August

I found a very strange Golem while scavenging for fuel today.

This Golem seemed strangely familiar, and was quite different from the Gatekeeper.

I think this Golem was... ...a mechanical pet, what was its name, that giant...

I'll disassemble it later.

I just can't get its damned face out of my mind!
