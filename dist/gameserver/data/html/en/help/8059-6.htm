Period 4 February

I heard an infernal racket outside today, and sent out a Probe Golem to investigate... It was those disgusting Dwarves again!

I'll wager those adena-grubbing dogs are drooling all over the Northern Mine. If it's not one thing it's another!

Of course the worst of the Dwarves haven't shown up yet, but...

Not only the Gray Pillar, but the Collectors and the Bronze Key are here! I heard some Dwarves knocking on the walls trying to find a way in...

It's only a matter of time until I'm discovered.
