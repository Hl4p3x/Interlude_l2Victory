I disassembled the Gatekeeper-type Golem. My suspicions were correct... It was the prototype that Toma created in his teleportation experiments! If I follow the blueprint from his lab I should be able to make it work.

I'll scavenge any parts I need from those dead Golems. I can improvise anything else I need!
