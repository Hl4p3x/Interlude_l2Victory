Period 3 June

I was able to seal the crack in the wall to keep out the cold. Of course, if I sealed it permanently, I couldn't get back out, so I fashioned a sort of door.

I think I could really get comfortable here! The plants are incredible!

I should at least stay here until the weather warms up!
