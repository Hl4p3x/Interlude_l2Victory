I've finally gotten it to output some energy, but it just won't work properly.

I theorized that the tower in the middle of the room was some sort of control device.  I connected the Golem to the tower and it immediately began to output some strange sort of data. <font color="LEVEL">W.D.L.</font>?   Could this be some sort of recognition code?
