!Warehouse Freightman Marty:

If you feel unsafe about carrying your money or items why don't you leave them with us? We Dwarves manage almost all the warehouse and bank business on the continent. We even have a branch inside the Ivory Tower where no royal family treats us without respect, don't you think we are trustworthy?
