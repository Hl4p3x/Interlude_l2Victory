!Warehouse Freightman Romp:

You should not feel safe just because you are near Aden Castle. If you let your guard down, you could lose your life. Due to our proximity to the border, you never know what sort of danger is lurking around the corner. You must never underestimate the importance of warehouses! If you have any precious items with you that need to be delivered to someone, you should store them in our warehouse! It's better than getting them robbed while carrying them around with you. Even if you are killed, your belongings will be safe with us.
