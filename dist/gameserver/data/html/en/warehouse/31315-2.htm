Skill Enchantment is a way of strengthening certain skills that have reached their natural limit. Any player who has completed their third occupation change and reached level 76 or more can enchant a skill with the help of a skill trainers.<br>

When enchanting a skill for the first time, pay particular attention to the methods of reinforcement. If there are two or more, the method will be determined during the first enchantment session. When enchanting a skill, carefully note the descriptions of each effect before choosing.<br>

Also pay particular attention to the success rate. All skill enchantments have a specified success rate. If enchantment fails, exp. and SP will be consumed and your skill will return to +0 status, so please check the success rate carefully before enchanting. The success rate improves as the player's level increases.<br>

You may be required to find specific NPC to enchant the skill. There are currently 20 NPCs in the game that allow Skill Enchantment. Among these, you must find the NPC that fits both your race and your occupation. If your race and occupation do not match the NPCs, the Skill Enchantment will not be allowed.<br>
