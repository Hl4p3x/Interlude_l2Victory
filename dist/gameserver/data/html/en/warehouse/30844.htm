!Warehouse Keeper Walderal:

When you are running a warehouse, whether you like it or not, you get to know all sorts of odd secrets.  For example, a few days ago, some high level official whose name I cannot reveal placed with us a very cute needlework doll&  The doll was very well made&  but it seemed like it wasn t worth the storage fee we charge.  What do you think this means?  Heh heh heh&
