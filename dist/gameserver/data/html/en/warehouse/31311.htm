!Warehouse Keeper Hugin:

Just because I spend my entire day here writing in ledgers doesn't mean that I'm bored! Not at all! While I keep the records of our inventory, I study the situation in the village. I can even tell when something bad is about to happen...

von Hellmann, Van Hacken... Remember to avoid these two names. Sorry, that's all I can say!
