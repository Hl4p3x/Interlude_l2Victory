Master Gideon:

I have traveled the world over but there is one thing I will never understand. Why do Humans tremble so at the thought of Black Magic?  The mere words are enough to fill their hearts with terror!

I find it unfathomable that a being who can face down spears and swords and use betrayal and cunning tricks so effortlessly is frightened of something so natural!

However they do seem to be up to something. Perhaps there is a  room hidden in the Ivory Tower which teaches Black Magic...?
