<html><head><body>Welcome to the <font color="LEVEL">Dueling Area</font>.
<br>Fighting and killing do not lead to chaos here. Death does not cause forfeiture of experience points or items. You may fight, kill and die as you please.<br>
The area outside the fence is a <font color="LEVEL">Peace Zone</font> where violence is not tolerated.<br>
*Warning: If a chaotic character whose PK count is 6 or higher dies in a dueling arena, he/she will drop an item at a certain rate of probability. (This does not apply to the 15-year-old-and-under players' server.)
