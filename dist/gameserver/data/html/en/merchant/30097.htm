!Trader Galladucci:

The luxury shop is once again open for business! We have a wide selection of exquisite weapons available, so please feel free to shop to your heart's content.

Ah, I must also inform you that our store no longer accept cash. I'm very sorry for any inconvenience, but I'm afraid that we must insist on payment with *crystals*.

If you are in need of armor or rare miscellaneous items, don't hesitate to ask my lovely wife here.
