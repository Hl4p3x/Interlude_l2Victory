!Trader Astrid:

You should always choose your purchases carefully! Just because something sparkles doesn't make it a diamond!  This is especially true when it comes to accessories! Never judge an item's quality by its outward appearance!

The same is true about people.  Do you see the Dwarf named Candice over there?  She may look like a child, but she's actually older than I am!
