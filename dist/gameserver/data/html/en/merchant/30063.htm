Welcome. This place may seem unfamiliar to you as we recently renovated our shop. We sell various life potions and magic potions which are the necessities for adventurers. Isn't it true that the significant difference between a novice adventurer and an experienced one is how well that person is equipped with these equipment? You're in luck, we've got some excellent items in our store, so go ahead and purchase some for your use.
