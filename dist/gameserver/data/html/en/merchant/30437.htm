!Trader Rolento:

I am Trader Rolento, of the Silver Scale Guild! I was dispatched here in the name of the guild for business purposes. There is no place as good as this trade road that connects Giran and the harbor of Gludin. Naturally, the guild executives do not wish to let go of such a place, but thanks to them, I am stuck here. Anyway, what do you need?
