Welcome!

An adventurer should be able to organize his equipment at any time. Back in the old days, I would have even given away some to encourage aspiring adventurers. But these days, there are too many adventurers, and with so much equipment that must be imported from overseas, that's just not feasible.

But the most important thing is for you to choose equipment that's right for you and your level.

Here, pick and choose!
