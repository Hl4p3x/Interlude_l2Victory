!Trader Varan:

Welcome to the general store, run by the famous brother and sister team.  You won't be disappointed, take a look.  Our shop makes items in cooperation with the Ivory Tower, famous for magic, as well as the Dwarven guild "Breath of Flame".  Actually, my sibling is a bit of a chatterbox... it is a good thing you've come to me.
