I bid you welcome. Welcome to the Ivory Tower.

The Ivory Tower is generally known as the lair for Magicians but actually a lot of people who aren't also come and go. For instance, me, I was once a Paladin that took a pledge to devote myself to Einhasad. I still try to devote myself.

...And, strange things happen at this tower, but if you think about them too much you will go crazy so don't be too nosy. It might dangerous.
