!Wharf Manager Volker:

Lately,I just can't keep thinking back to the good old days... At one time, there were Grecian trading ships anchored here every day! Aye, we even surpassed Giran and Heine!

Alas, the bloody war put an end to that! These days, only small ferries show up here, with the occasional odd ocean-going ship carrying adeventures...

Come to think of it, the ferry to Gludin Harbor in the Kingdom of Aden began to run recently! I've heard that it's even got a regular schedule! You should give it a try!
