!Trader Sabrin:

People aren t so generous anymore, because of the peasant uprising a few years back. In troubled times like these, you must be responsible for your own defense! Our shop's wares are fundamentally different from those crude items sold in the back country of Talking Island. We have the highest quality weapons and defensive items to guard your life. There s no need to buy, just take a look.
