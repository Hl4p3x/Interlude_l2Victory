!Feed Seller:

Welcome to our pastures! Would you like to try your hand at raising a wild beast? If you're good, he'll obey you, if not, he'll make a good dinner! You have your choice of feed, *gold spice* or *Crystal Spice*.

Gold spice fattens them up while the Crystal Spice makes them tougher. If you want to raise a fat beast, feed it gold spice. If you want to raise a robust beast, feed it Crystal Spice.

Maybe you should try both, and compare!
