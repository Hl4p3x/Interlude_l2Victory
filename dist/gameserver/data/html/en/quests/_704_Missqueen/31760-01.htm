Adventurers' Guide Miss Queen:

Welcome! I've been dispatched from the Adventurer's Guild to guide characters new to the world of Lineage II.

In celebration of the arrival of a new era, the guild has temporarily opened its weapons warehouse to all new adventurers who have reached level 6 for the first time, or who have completed their very first occupation change. If you meet these requirements, I'll give you a *weapon exchange coupon* and permit you to *rent the weapon of your choice from the Adventurer's Guild weapons warehouse*. Bear in mind, this coupon is only valid until you reach level 25. Are you ready to choose your weapon?

(Any character with a PK count of 1 or above is not eligible to receive the coupon.)
