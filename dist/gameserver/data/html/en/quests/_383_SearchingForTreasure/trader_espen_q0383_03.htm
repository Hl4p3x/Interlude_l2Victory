As a way of escaping my boring daily life, I have a hobby of collecting pirate memorabilia. I'm especially interested in anything to do with Zaken, the legendary scourge of the high seas.

It is said that he was once Zaken's boatswain, and when Zaken's ship was anchored at Innadril Harbor, he made off with a few Treasure Chests and stashed them somewhere on Alligator Island.

But, the exact location of the Treasure Chests hasn't been discovered yet...
