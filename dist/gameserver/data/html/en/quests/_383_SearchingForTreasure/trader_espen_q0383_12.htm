You should thank your lucky stars for running into me. Why? Because I'm the only person in the world who can decipher this Map.

I recently purchased Zaken's journal from some adventurers who had been exploring on Devil's Isle. It contained a detailed description of the method of decoding the pirates' jargon. Although Zaken was a seemingly fearless pirate who dominated all the great oceans, he was an unexpectedly cautious individual. He wrote a very detailed explanation of the code in his journal, as though he was afraid of forgetting how to decipher it...

Now, I've told you everything I know. Come on, show me the Map. Let's find out where the treasure is hidden!

These are the coordinates on the Map. Let me see... 12 feathers of parrot... 50 glasses of rum... the coordinates are...

Oh, it's right there! It is the northern part of Alligator Beach! Ha ha! It's not far from here. I will mark it on your Map.

Phew... all my life I have followed the legend of Zaken... And now my fate is just to interpret the Map for someone else... What a disappointment! Well, all I can do is ask you to be a brave treasure hunter...

Now, get going! Find the finale of the legend... Ah! One last piece of advice... To open a Treasure Chest you must first obtain a *Thief Key*!
