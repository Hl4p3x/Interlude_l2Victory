!Guard Luis:

I've been looking for someone like you.

I trust you've seen the havoc wrought throughout Gludio Territory. It was enough to have Ol Mahum Stragglers and Turek Orcs bothering us. Now the lizardmen from the south!

The *highway of the southern shoreline* that leads to Giran has seen frequent attacks by *Langk Lizardmen*. People are scared. Even the temple priests traveling to Gludin were attacked! We Gludio guards are already stretched thin.

Will you help us?
