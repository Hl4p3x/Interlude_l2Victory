!Guard Luis:

Many thanks.

The Langk Lizardman tribe used to keep to themselves on the southern shoreline, hunting and looting. Our scouts tell us that they've become organized and pose a serious threat!

Some of their warriors are said to possess incredible new powers!

We need your help clearing the southern shoreline road of Langk lizardmen. There are mainly *Langk Lizardman sentinels* and *Langk Lizardman lieutenants* threatening the roadway. Bring back 100 Feather Ornaments worn by Langk Lizardman Warriors as proof of your deed.

Keep on the lookout for anything suspicious that might explain their sudden aggression. Good luck!
