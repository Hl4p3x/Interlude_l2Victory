!Guard Luis:

Your face is unfamiliar. You must be a traveler.

I trust you've seen the havoc wrought throughout Gludio Territory? It was enough to have Ol Mahum stragglers and Turek Orcs bothering us... Now the lizardmen from the south!

The *highway of the southern shoreline* that leads to Giran has seen frequent attacks by *Langk Lizardman*. People are scared. Even the temple priests traveling to Gludin were attacked! We Gludio guards are already stretched thin. We need more experienced help.

(Only a character of level 19 or above may undertake this quest.)
