!Magister Iris:

Come in! Have you completed your mission? I'm impressed! What? You haven't collected all of them yet?

If we are to cancel the sorcery of the Langk lizardmen, you must bring me *50 dragon teeth*. Get them from *Langk Lizardman shamans and captains* that can be found in the *deepest parts of the Langk Lizardmen Dwellings*.
