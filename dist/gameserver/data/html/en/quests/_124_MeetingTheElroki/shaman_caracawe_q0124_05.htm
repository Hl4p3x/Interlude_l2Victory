!Shaman Karakawei:

Lost to my people's memory, unremembered and unknown, I, Elrokian of old, speak with you!

The wisdom of the ancestors is this: find the egg laid by the Mantarasa dinosaur. The gods have bestowed upon it the gift of healing. To find it, make your mind as light as an eagle's feather and as clean as the morning dew and travel north.

You will find the *Mantarasa Egg* on the *border between the Primeval Plains and the Lost Nest*. Only the Mantarasa Egg can save these poor children of the Elroki. May their former glory be restored to them!
