!Asamah:

Marquez sent you? Thanks be to Shilen! I am Asamah, who asked Marquez to send an adventurer to help us.

You spoke a little while ago with my father, Chief Mushika. He is only a shadow of his former self, tied to this life only by his will and his warrior pride. He is in such agony of body and spirit that the people are frightened out of their wits!

We have never seen such an illness and do not know how to cure it. We are powerless even to soothe some of his pain! But with your coming I have hope at last! It is as if Shilen herself has answered my prayers.
