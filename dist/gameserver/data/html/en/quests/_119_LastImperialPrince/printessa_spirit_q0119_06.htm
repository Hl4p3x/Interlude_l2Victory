!Nameless Spirit:

Thank you! Honestly, I heard from an adventurer who stopped by that *Nurse Devorin* is still alive in *Rune Township*! If you don't mind, would you go meet with her and learn the *lyrics of the lullaby*? If you show Nurse Devorin the Antique Brooch, she'll know I sent you. Please, help me!
