!Nameless Spirit:

He probably used *the lullaby I heard when I was young*. That has to be it! When I was young, my parents were always busy, so I was practically raised by my nurse! Sometimes when I couldn't fall asleep, the nurse would just smile with a sultry look and sing a beautiful lullaby.

I'll bet he used that lullaby as the password for the force field... Too many years have passed! I can remember the melody, but I can't remember the lyrics at all!

Could you do me a favor? Would you please go to *Rune Township*?
