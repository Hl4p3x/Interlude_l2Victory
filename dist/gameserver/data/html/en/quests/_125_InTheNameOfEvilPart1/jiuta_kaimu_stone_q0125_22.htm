!Chuta Kaimu:

This fragment is surely a remnant of the ax Gazkh, which was once wielded by Elrokian warriors at the peak of the tribe's power. When you reawakened me, I first helped you only out of a sense of gratitude -- after all, you are not even an Elrokian warrior! But now I believe that you are truly the outsider of whom the prophecies speak. Blessed be the name of Shilen!
