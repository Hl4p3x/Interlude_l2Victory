!Ulu Kaimu:

I am Ulu Kaimu, a Pillar of Wisdom whose name means "eyes watching earth" in the Elrokian tongue. You used Shilen's word to awaken me!

Now you know how to communicate with me, so tell me: How is it that you came to know that word? If you have awakened me for some mundane thing, you will not survive your blasphemy...
