!Mushika:

Thank you for saying that. Asamah and I suspect that my illness is somehow connected to our ancient home, the Lost Nest.

Nor do we think that our troubles have ended simply because I have been restored to health.

But in you, I see the fated link that will reconnect my people with our past and our future. The moment my eyes beheld you, my spirit told me that you are the one destined to save the Elroki.
