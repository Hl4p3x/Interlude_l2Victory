!Karakawei:

The ancestors have told me that the word is *tepu*. And they have also revealed that the monument stands beneath a tree at the end of the *northeast* part of the Lost Nest.

This was all I heard before my strength was exhausted and my spirit fled back to my body.

But I fear that you will face obstacles on this journey that I cannot foresee.
