!Balu Kaimu:

The end of paradise was heralded by the sharp claws of Sailren the dinosaur. Violent and vicious, Sailren almost seemed clothed in flame. Not even the greatest Elrokian warrior could tame it.

Finally, Shilen ordered Sailren isolated on a remote part of the island, far from civilization. Many Elrokian warriors perished in the capture of that terrible creature.

Only Shilen's help made it possible, but from that day on, the balance of the island was lost. In the years that followed, most of the seal stones -- even the fabric of civilization itself -- were destroyed by dinosaurs that had become impossible to control.
