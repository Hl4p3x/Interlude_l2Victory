!Mushika:

Thank you for saying that. Asamah and I do not think that everything has been set right simply because I have been cured.

My illness was no coincidence, my foreign friend. I suspect that it is connected to something in our people's distant past. And in you I see the fated link that will reconnect our past and our future. The moment my eyes beheld you, my spirit told me so.
