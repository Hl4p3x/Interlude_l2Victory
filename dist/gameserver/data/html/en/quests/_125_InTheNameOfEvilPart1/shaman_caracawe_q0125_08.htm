!Karakawei:

Alas, no one knows for certain if it even still exists. But through my sorcery, I can summon the spirits of my ancestors and ask for their guidance.

The ritual will require special materials that I do not have, however.

I will especially need *Ornithomimus' claws and Deinonychus' bone fragments* to perform the ritual. Can you obtain those materials for me?
