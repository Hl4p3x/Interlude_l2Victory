!Chuta Kaimu:

With the Lost Nest no longer under Shilen's rule, the goddess was unable to continue to protect the Elroki tribe, and much of the Elrokians' power derived from her mighty magic was lost.

Meanwhile, freed from Elrokian control, the dinosaurs roamed unfettered throughout the land, wreaking havoc wherever they went.

The Elroki tribe was forced to flee to the Primeval Plains, where they settled and became a mere shadow of their former selves. Gone were the mighty Elrokian warriors, replaced by timid villagers and short-sighted leaders. Eventually, their descendants even forgot their true heritage and their true home.

But in you I see the spirit of a true Elrokian warrior of old! Fate has decreed that you should be the one to help save their race and restore them to their ancient glory.
