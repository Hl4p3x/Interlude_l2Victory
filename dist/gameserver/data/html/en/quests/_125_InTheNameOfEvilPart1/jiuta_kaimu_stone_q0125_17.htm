!Chuta Kaimu:

It is not true that Shilen abandoned this island. The truth is that she was stripped of her right to govern after she was seduced by her father, Gran Kain. Although the crime was his, it was Shilen who was punished, and it was the Lost Nest that suffered most.

History scorns Shilen for this act, judging her as willful, cold-hearted and selfish. But this island's creatures know the truth.

Far from cold-hearted, Shilen loved even the primitive creatures that the other gods had forsaken. As their mother-goddess, she fretted about their safety and the future of this island until the moment her position was usurped.
