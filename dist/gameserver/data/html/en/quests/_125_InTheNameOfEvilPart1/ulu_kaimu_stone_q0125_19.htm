!Ulu Kaimu:

Shilen made several brothers like me in order that the history of the island might be recorded from many different angles. She created us in groups and granted us the power to communicate among ourselves, that we might share our wisdom with each other.

But because Shilen was concerned that Kaimus might abuse the wisdom she gave us, she alone knows how many stone pillars have life.

Among them, I can communicate only with one brother Kaimu. I do not know if he possesses the wisdom that you seek.
