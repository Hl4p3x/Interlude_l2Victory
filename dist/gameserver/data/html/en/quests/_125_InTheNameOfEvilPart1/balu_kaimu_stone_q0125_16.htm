!Balu Kaimu:

Long, long ago, when all the dinosaurs had finished their migration to the Lost Nest under the supervision of the Elkrokhian warriors, Elkrokhian civilization was at its peak.

The seal stones set in place by my mother Shilen and the statues that reflected her beauty were arranged in perfect harmony. The island was fertile and peaceful.

Shilen even enlisted the help of the other gods to make this place a a true paradise. Dinosaurs and Elrokians coexisted in peace and prosperity in those days.
