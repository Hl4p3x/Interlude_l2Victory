!Beast Herder Tunatun:

Aaah...  Pastoral scenes like this make me wish I could see these cute little critters grow up!

They look cute, but you can never forget that they're wild beasts!  There's no way I can handle them all on my own... Do you know anyone who could help me raise them?

It's a very dangerous job! It's not for just anyone...
