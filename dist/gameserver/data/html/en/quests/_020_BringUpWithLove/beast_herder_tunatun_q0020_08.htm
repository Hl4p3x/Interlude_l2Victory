Beast Herder Tunatun:

Please bring me a Jewel of Innocence.  This isn't something you can purchase, or kill something for... You must earn it by raising a beast yourself! <br> Alas, this is an honor that only comes once in a lifetime...  I'll never forget my little beast...  And the brilliance of that gemstone!

If only I could possess one again... Could you please bring a Jewel of Innocence to me?
