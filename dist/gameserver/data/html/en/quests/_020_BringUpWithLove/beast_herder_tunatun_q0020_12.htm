Oh, a Jewel of Innocence!  Isn't it beautiful?! See how it sparkles...

Sob!  I'm sorry! Just looking at it breaks my heart!

I was so young!  So full of hopes and dreams... all but forgotten now...

Now I think I can do it!  My dream...  to create a world in which everyone understands each other...

I'm not sure how I'll do it, but I'll make it work somehow!
