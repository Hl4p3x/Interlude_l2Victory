!Magister Nell:

This won't be easy. The spirits that live in the Forgotten Temple are very strong. You will need help. You can get

*Flare Shards* from *lakin salamanders, salamander rowins and death fires*. *Freezing Shards* can be obtained from *the lakin undine, the rowin undine and the roxide*. Please bring me *50 of each type*.
