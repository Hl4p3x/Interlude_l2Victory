!Warehouse Keeper Kluck:

Let's go over your mission again.

First, go to Alligator Island and hunt *Crokian Lads, Dailaon Lads, Crokian Lad Warriors, Parhit Lads, North Lads and Swamp Chiefs* and bring me their teeth as evidence.

I will reward you based on the number of teeth you bring.

I will give you an additional reward if you bring me 100 or more teeth all at once.

Anything else you find while hunting is yours to keep.

Remember, you'll have to swim to Alligator Island, so I hope you're not afraid to get wet! Ha ha!
