!Warehouse Keeper Kluck:

Oh! More map fragments?! Let's see. Put this piece here and that piece there...it's like solving a puzzle! There! Just about done. Hmm, it looks like it marks the location of a hidden treasure!

I think I heard a rumor that some of the treasure of the legendary pirate Zaken is buried on Alligator Island. It was apparently stolen away and hidden by the bosun's mistress...

Ha ha! According to the terms of our contract, all items you find on Alligator Island are yours. That means that map is yours as well! Go see *Merchant Aspen at the Weapon Store* -- I've heard he knows all about Zaken.
