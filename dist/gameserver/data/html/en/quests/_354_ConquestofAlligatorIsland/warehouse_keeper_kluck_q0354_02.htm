!Warehouse Keeper Kluck:

Too busy! Arggh! Hey...you, there! Adventurer! You came at the right time. Looking for work?

As you know, trading is a specialty of the Dwarves. But now a few Human merchants have bribed some high-ranking officials to be allowed to take over the trade routes to Innadril, Abella and Giran. They're not letting us Dwarves do business any more!

We're thinking about creating a new free trade zone on Alligator Island. But there are too many monsters ther right now.

Interested in getting rid of them for us? You'll be well paid for your efforts...
