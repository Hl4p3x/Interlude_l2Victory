!Antique Dealer Patrin:

Just a moment... Let me get my reading glasses...

Now, what have we here? Hmm...

Oh Oh...!

Hmm...?!

This is a *prototype* made by the very hands of Berona! This was used to make molds from which many other statues were produced. You must understand that this is one of the most valuable antiques you will ever find. It will fetch a handsome price at any store.
