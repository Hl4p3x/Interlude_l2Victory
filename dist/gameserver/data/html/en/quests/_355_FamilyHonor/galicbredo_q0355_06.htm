!Trader Galibredo:

Welcome back! I've been waiting for you. Were you successful? I trust that you destroyed the Timak Orc troop and brought back my goods?

As I told you, all I want is "Galfredo Romer's Busts". You can keep the other *works of sculptor Berona* for yourself. You should be able to sell them for a fairly good price.

Or... if you would like, you can also take them to the *antique dealer Patrin* over there and get them appraised. Since we are close friends, I'll put in a good word for you. If the statues are prototypes or originals they are more valuable. If they are imitations or fakes, then they are worthless. It's a gamble.
