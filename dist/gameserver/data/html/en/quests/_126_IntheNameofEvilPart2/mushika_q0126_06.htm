!Mushika:

I read this document over and over again, but I never thought the password was hidden inside.

I didn't know that this book was really a secret document written in ancient secret passwords -- like others, I read it only with scholarly interest.

But although this seems to be like any other document, through proper decryption we can discover its hidden meaning.

Legend has it that our ancestors once shared their secret documents in this way, but I've never seen such a thing before.
