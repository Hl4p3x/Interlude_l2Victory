!Asamah:

In brief, my father found a fragment of the ax within the Lost Nest. Somehow the fragment injured him, and soon after he succumbed to this mysterious illness.

I'm sure that you have also heard of the strange occurrences that have been witnessed here of late. I'm almost sure that both they and my father's unnatural illness are somehow connected to the Lost Nest and Gazkh.
