!Asamah:

When Eva became the goddess of water, it was the single most unfortunate thing to befall our tribe up to that time. Shilen's misfortune continued from that day onward, and eventually she became slanderously known as a goddess of evil or a goddess of death. Some historians also began describing her as the avatar of evil.

But I have heard that other, less-biased historical documents depict Shilen as a victim of Eva's insatiable jealousy. They say that not only did we lose our wise and strong goddess, but that all the suffering and chaos in our world is a reflection of Eva's spiteful heart.
