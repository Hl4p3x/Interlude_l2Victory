!Warrior's Grave:

It is not a complex melody, but perhaps an outsider such as yourself finds it more difficult to sing than a born Elrokian warrior who has heard it from birth. Concentrate! You must try again -- the fate of this island depends on it!

Remember, you must perfectly sing every single scale of each of the 3 verses.
