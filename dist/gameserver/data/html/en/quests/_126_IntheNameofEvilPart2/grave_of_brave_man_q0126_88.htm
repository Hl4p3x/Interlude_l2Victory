!Warrior's Grave:

Yes, these are all that remains of my mortal body, summoned forth from their resting place by the power of your Warrior's Song to perform one final duty.

As you take these ashes, accept my spirit! We are now linked, you and I. Take these ashes and go to the end of the *southeast* area. It was there that Sailren was supposedly sealed. Examine the area carefully for the seal stone; it should be there as well.
