!Chuta Kaimu:

Here is the wisdom that you seek.

Outsider of fate, Shilen's will is that you now travel to the *Warrior's Grave* and pray over it with a true heart. Then you will receive what you require.

The grave lies at *the end of the southwest* area. Take this fragment of Gazkh that you showed me, whose memories have revealed this wisdom to me.

If only you could restore the fragment to its rightful master!
