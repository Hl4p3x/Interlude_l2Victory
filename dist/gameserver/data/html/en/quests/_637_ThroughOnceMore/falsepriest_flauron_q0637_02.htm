!Priest Flauron:

Ha! You surprise me. I hadn't expected to see you again. Not alive, anyway. Did you learn much from your visit?

Oh, don't look at me like that. It doesn't matter anyway. You're not experienced enough to take on this quest, and I am doing you a favor by telling you so.

(Only characters who have the Faded Visitor's Mark and are level 73 or above are permitted to take on this quest.)
