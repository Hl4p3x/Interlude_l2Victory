!Priest Flauron:

Ha! Excellent! Quickly, give it to me, before someone sees us! What am I going to use it for, you ask? Heh. Ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no lies!

Well, you've done your part, and I'll do mine. Here, let me give you the *Pagan's Mark*. There! You will no longer need the Visitor's Mark; this one will work better, and will admit you to the chapel - that, and the key to the Anteroom, which I now give you.

What's inside the chapel? Now, that would be telling.

What are we doing there? Ha ha! Don't bother asking me such questions. Go find out for yourself! Stop us if you can!

Your numbers won't help you as much as you think. It is good that you recognize your weakness and that you bring your comrades with you, but it won't help you. Lord Triol long ago realized the danger of attack by a well-coordinated band of adventurers, and cast a spell that will scatter groups of outsiders to the four winds!

Be sensible, then. Surely you realize the futility of fighting us. The fact that I just gave you a free pass into the chapel should tell you something: We are not afraid of you. Think about that.

(If a party of six or more fight inside The Pagan Temple, there is a chance that one or more party members will be teleported to another place.)
