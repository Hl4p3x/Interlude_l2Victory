!Priest Flauron:

Oh, that. Disregard that; it was a minor matter. You have survived and gained by your experiences, surely. How can that be bad? Keep your thoughts on the future, that is my motto!

Look, let's deal. I'm not going to try any more tricks. I know better now. If I'd known you for what you were, I'd never have tried it in the first place. But I have a job that needs doing, and I can offer you a real benefit in exchange:  *the mark that lets you go all the way into the chapel of the temple*. I think that's where you want to go, am I right?
