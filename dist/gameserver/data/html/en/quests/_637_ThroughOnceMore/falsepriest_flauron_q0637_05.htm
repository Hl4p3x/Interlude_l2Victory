!Priest Flauron:

You already have the Mark of the Pagan, so you don't need to hear this story again.

Oh, by the way, a little reminder for you: Although you realized your own frailty and brought your comrades with you, don't imagine that your combined might can do anything to stop us. Lord Triol was quite aware of the danger a party of adventurers might present, so he *cast a spell that will scatter an invading party to the winds.* So don't waste your time fighting us â€” you'll never prevail.

(If a party of six or more fight inside the Pagan Temple, there is a chance that some of the party members will be teleported elsewhere.)
