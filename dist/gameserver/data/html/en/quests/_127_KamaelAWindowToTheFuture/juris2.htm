Magister Juris:

Dominic selected his collaborators from factions of each race who were dissatisfied with the terms of the Giran Treaty. The local Elven Magisters have joined this...ah, conspiracy...ostensibly because of conflicts with the Elven leaders of the Innadril region.

But this is actually just a ruse. Whatever happens, we must prevent the other races from allying against the Elves.

Our participation in this cabal provides us a opportunity to listen to the other races' position on the Kamael and gives us much-needed time to consider their proposals.
