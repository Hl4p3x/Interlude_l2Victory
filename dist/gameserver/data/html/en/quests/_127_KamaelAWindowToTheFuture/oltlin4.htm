Grand Master Oltlin:

Very well. All that is left is to give you the mark you require; here it is. Against my better judgment, I must tell you the name of the Elven collaborator. Listen closely! Find *Magister Juris* in Giran Castle Town.

Once you have heard what he says, find me again and tell me when the opportunity presents itself. I want to hear for myself what words come forth from his moon-face! Be not deceived, however, he is a deep and treacherous creature.

Be on your way, and may Shilen guide you on your journey! I will await your report
