Klaus Blackbird:

Excellent! Your decision warms my heart. Now commit this password to memory: *Name that Opens the Future*. And take this mark, which is called the *Mark of Future*. Take it to *Warehouse Chief Alder in Schuttgart Castle Town* and he will give you his report, as well as the mark you will require to obtain the next collaborator's report. When you have collected a report from each collaborator, deliver the information to Dominic.

By the way, the quickest way to reach Alder in Schuttgart Castle Town is to pass through Rune Town. May Gran Kain smile on your journey!
