Warehouse Chief Alder:

You say you came from Rune Township? Ah! Well, I'm glad that a hardy adventurer like yourself has taken on this mission. Not long ago, a stranger appeared in town and talked noisily about mishaps regarding the Kamael -- we were worried that he might spoil things by attracting too much attention.

I'm relieved to see that you seem like a calm and intelligent-looking person.

But since there are many prying eyes and listening ears nearby, let me give you only the information you need to know right now. Remember it well and deliver it promptly!

Ready?
