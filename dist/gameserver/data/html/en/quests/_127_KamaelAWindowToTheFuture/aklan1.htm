High Prefect Aklan:

Finally, the one with the Mark of Future has appeared! That Human must have set things in motion after all. Well, it matters little. I wanted to see you was because I wish to make known the Orcs' position regarding the Kamael.

Listen to my words as though Pa'agrio himself speaks to you!
