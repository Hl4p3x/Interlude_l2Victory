High Prefect Aklan:

Since you have answered fully, I will end our conversation with this. Ah, and I have something to give you. I believe it is called the Mark of Future. I have heard that without this, my story will not be passed on.

Now listen carefully. Go to *Grand Master Oltlin* and listen to the thoughts of the Dark Elven race. He is supposed to be in the western area of Aden Castle Town in Aden territory.

I have not spoken so fully for a very long time; I must rest now. Be on your way, and speak the words of the Orcs truly!
