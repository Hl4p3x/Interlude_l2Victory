Sir Kristof Rodemai:

Needless to say, I do not entirely agree with the Elves' opinions. But I do think that we need to look at the Kamael situation objectively.

There will undoubtedly be a whole herd of eager young adventurers like yourself ready to acquaint themselves with the Kamael; I hope that an opinion like mine will also be heard. I believe that an adventurer interested in the Kamael and committed to neutrality is well suited to hear my words and deliver them truthfully to the world, neither adding to nor subtracting from my tale. Vou seem a likely candidate -- may I tell you my story?
