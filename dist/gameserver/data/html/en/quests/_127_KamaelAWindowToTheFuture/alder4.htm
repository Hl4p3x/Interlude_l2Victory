Warehouse Chief Alder:

Confidential information about the Kamael. We have already attempted to contact the Kamael, and although we were unsuccessful, we nevertheless learned more about them than all of the other races combined.

Because of that, we want our research to be kept secret.

And because of our efforts, we believe that the Iron Gate Guild, with its wide-ranging influence and firm economic foundation, should be in charge of the efforts regarding the Kamael from this point on. Now, then...have you understood what I have told you?
