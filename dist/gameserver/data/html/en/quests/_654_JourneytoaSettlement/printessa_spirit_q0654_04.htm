!Nameless Spirit:

Ah, anyhow... *Something like parchment will work for passing the Force Field*. As long as I can write spells on it. Can you go to *Argos' wall* and defeat either *Canyon Antelope* or *Canyon Antelope Slave*, and bring *Antelope Hide*? A well polished hide is as good as parchment.

Ah! For your information, *everybody in the group would need a scroll to pass the Force Field.* So everybody needs an Antelope Hide.
