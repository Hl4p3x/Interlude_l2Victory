!Nameless Spirit:

Can you go to *Argos' wall* and defeat either *Canyon Antelope* or *Canyon Antelope Slave*, and bring *Antelope Hide*? If you tan and polish the hide, it could be used instead of parchment.

And *everybody in the group should have this scroll when passing the Force Field.* So all will need a hide.
