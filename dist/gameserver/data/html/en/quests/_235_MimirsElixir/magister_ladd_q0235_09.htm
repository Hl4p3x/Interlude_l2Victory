Certainly not! How can you make something from only one ingredient? Are you kidding?

We must also have *True Gold*, of course.

But I'm afraid it won't be easy to find. When I gave up my studies many years ago, I gave what I had left to *Magister Joan* along with the recipe for making the elixir. I wonder if she's still got it? Well, it wouldn't hurt to ask her.
