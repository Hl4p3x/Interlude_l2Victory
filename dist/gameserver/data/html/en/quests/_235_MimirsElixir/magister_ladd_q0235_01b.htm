!Magister Ladd:

Not long ago, a stranger visited me asking about the research that I performed long ago. He seemed very familiar to me... Who was that?...

He got me thinking about things I haven't thought about in years... I remember thinking how the research was really dangerous, and I stopped doing it because I feared the effect it could have on our true essence...

But the stranger said...

"Soon, a traveler carrying a Star of Destiny will come to see you.<br1>It is he who shall take control in the future era of chaos. He must learn how to escape the shackles of fate forced on him by the gods.

Ladd, you must tell him how..."
