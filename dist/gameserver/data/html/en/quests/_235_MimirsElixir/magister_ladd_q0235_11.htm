!Magister Ladd:

Wonderful! You've brought pure gold!

Now comes the hard part... What always stopped my research was the fact that the mixing of True Gold and Pure Silver cannot be accomplished with ordinary fire. It always loses its purity.

But recently I received a hint to the solution from a man wearing black armor... He had been following my research, and doing quite a bit on his own...

But as I said, my only role is to help you.
