!Magister Ladd:

OK, then... Um.

"Break the chains of race and class,

and be truly free.

Dance to the rhythm of nature,

Rejoice in the beauty of the stars.

Don't worry about tomorrow,

Enjoy small victories and learn in baby steps.

Remember, life is an illusion." These words fit you well.

OK, drink Mimir's Elixir. It will be the catalyst and your mind the ingredient. Your spirit is the fire that melds these together. Your body and mind will be reformed by  the elixir. Are you ready?
