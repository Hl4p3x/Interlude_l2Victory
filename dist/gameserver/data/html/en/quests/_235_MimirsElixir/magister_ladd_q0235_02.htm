!Magister Ladd:

Recently a stranger came to see me. He wore black armor and seemed other-worldly. He was accompanied by a young, blonde girl. He said...

"Soon, a traveler carrying a Star of Destiny will visit you and ask about Mimir's Elixir. It is he who will take control in the future era of chaos. Ladd, you must tell him how to break the shackles placed upon him by the gods."

You are the one of whom he spoke!  Are you a hero? Do you feel like one?

You don't have to answer that. It will become obvious in time. Come to think of it, why was the blonde girl shaking her head?

Do you think you could create *Mimir's Elixir*? I think you could. But whether or not you could endure life after drinking it... That is another story. Finding your own fate is sometimes harder than swimming with armor on.
