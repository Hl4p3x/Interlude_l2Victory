!Magister Ladd:

You've really done it! This is Mimir's Elixir, the ultimate reagent! How is it used? It's very simple - you just swallow it! The only reason I told you to come back and see me is because I'm curious about the elixir's effects.

But before you drink it... While you were at the Watcher's Tomb, the man in dark armor came back. He asked me to give this letter to you. I just took a quick look... It contains characters from the ancient Ferios language. I can count on one hand all the people on this continent who can read it. I am one of them... If you wish, I will read the letter for you.
