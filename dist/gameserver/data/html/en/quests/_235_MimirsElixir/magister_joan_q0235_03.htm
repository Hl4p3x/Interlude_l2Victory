!Magister Joan:

Very good! You shall leave immediately for the *Silent Valley*!

I want you to deal with the *chimera piece*. You'll find many other creatures there, but they're all shadows of the same being. Though only one holds the Sage's Stone, there's really no way of telling which one it is. Just keep killing chimera pieces until you find it. Thank you. Now get going!
