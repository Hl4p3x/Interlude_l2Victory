!Magister Joan:

Have you heard of the Sage's Stone? It's a crystal that one must make in order to be recognized as a mage. The manufacturing process actually changes the basic properties of matter, and is fundamental in all magical research.

The reason I'm telling you this is... To manufacture True Gold, I must have a *Sage's Stone*.

And you see, I had one, but... It's a long story... Uh, there was an explosion of sorts... it occurred during an experiment.

Anyway, I don't have it anymore. Would you get one for me? If you'll get me a Sage's Stone, I'll make True Gold for you.
