!Magister Ladd:

Long ago, I studied potions. The magic of the giants, secrets of the gods... That was the stuff of my research.

But such knowledge is not for mere mortals such as us... I sealed that research and put it out of my mind for a long time.

However, recently, I've been thinking... If some hero was to come along that didn't fear the wrath of the gods... If I happened to meet such a hero, I think I might just be willing to restart my research!
