!Magister Joan:

You've brought me the Sage's Stone! Good job! This precious little stone is the motivating force of my magic! I feel as though a part of my own flesh has been returned to me...

I shall make your True Gold right away. I'll blend these reagents, heat it up, use the Sage's Stone...

Now we must wait. Would you like some advice while we're waiting?
