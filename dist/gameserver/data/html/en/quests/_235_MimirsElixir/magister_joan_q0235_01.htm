!Magister Joan:

What's the world coming to? Magister Ladd, asking for help?

He wants True Gold, eh? I'll wager he's restarted his research into Mimir's Elixir! He swore he'd given it up!

He gave all of his True Gold to me, and said he wouldn't need it again! And now you've come, asking for it back! I suppose he thought I would just keep it for him? Ha! I used it up long ago!

If he really needs it, I can make more. But it won't be easy...
