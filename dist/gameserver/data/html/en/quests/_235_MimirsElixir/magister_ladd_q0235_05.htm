!Magister Ladd:

Some heroes reject destiny, and some have it thrust upon them... For instance, Raul, the Unification King, was chosen by the Goddess of the Lake, and there was Emperor Shunaiman, who received power from Einhasad... Don't you agree that they were chosen by the gods?

Those who are chosen have no use for Mimir's Elixir.

But the Star of Destiny... that's another story...

Do you want to make Mimir's Elixir? How about it? Can you handle the power?
