!Magister Ladd:

It has also been a long time since I last spoke with him.

But he gave me courage and a mission at a point in my life where I had given up my research and was deeply depressed.

Thanks to him, I was able to resume the research that I had abandoned, and I was able to discover a way to escape from the wheel of fate that had been destined by the gods.

At that time, he told me to tell this information to someone of a different faith who came in search of it.

<center>*You who have escaped the wheel of the gods -- only you can escape from the lash of fate.*</center>

<center>*The oldest one among you will know the way.*</center>Those were his words.

This is all I can tell you. I am sorry I can be of no other help.
