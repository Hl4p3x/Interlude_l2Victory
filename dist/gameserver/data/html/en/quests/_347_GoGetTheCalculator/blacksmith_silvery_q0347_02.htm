!Blacksmith Silvera:

Ha! The Calculator? Why are you bothering me for it? Certainly you can find another Dwarf to get one from!

Okay. You win. Actually, I'm tired of carrying it around. I hoped to exchange it for something more useful or pretty, but in this village, nobody has anything I find interesting... Sigh!

Bring me something pretty and I'll give you the Calculator! I want some new crystals, and I know just where you can find some! Not far from here the *Gemstone Beasts* hoard their crystals. They shine so brightly it shouldn't be hard to find them. <br>Oh, I can't wait! Bring me 10 crystals from the *Gemstone Beasts* and I'll give you the Calculator.
