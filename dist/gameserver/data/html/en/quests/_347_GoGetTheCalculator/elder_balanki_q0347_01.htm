!Silver Scale's Balanki:

A new type of Calculator, eh? Well, unfortunately, our guild does not make these, but I could tell you who does...

Of course, as you know, nothing comes for free. However, this shouldn't be much, just a small token of good faith...

I'll give you the information for only 100 Adena. It's not like I need the money... As you know, I am an elder, and such sums are nothing to me. All I require is a demonstration of your gratitude.
