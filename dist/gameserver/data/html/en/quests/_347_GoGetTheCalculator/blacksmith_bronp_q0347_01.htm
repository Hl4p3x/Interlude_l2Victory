!Blacksmith Brunon:

What goes through your mind when you gaze upon the silvery moon? Have you ever dreamed of visiting that cold and desolate place? Just think of the strange and wonderful minerals there! Imagine the discoveries you could make!

Many have tried to reach the moon but so far all have failed. There was the catapult, a miserable failure. Someone got the idea to have a golem hurl a vehicle there, also a tragedy. Many noble Dwarves have given their lives in this endeavor.

So you wish to attempt this feat? To go where no Dwarf has gone before? Good! I have a plan, my 18th actually, that I am sure will get you safely there and back. We have thought of everything that could go possibly go wrong! Bwa ha ha ha!
