!Seer Reva:

Congratulations on your safe return, young soldier! Word has come that the tower has become a chaotic entanglement of angels and demons. I trust that you have recovered many of the *Ancient Ash Urns* from Hallate's warriors, knights and commanders!

The *Ancient Porcelain* you brought doesn't contain any remains. It was only used for decoration! It's no good to me, you can keep it for yourself! Either sell it at a store or take it to *antique dealer Patrin*! He is at the general store in the Town of Oren.

[Quest _371_ShriekOfGhosts reply_1|Hand over the Ancient Ash Urns.]

[Quest _371_ShriekOfGhosts reply_2|Settle the account later.]

[Quest _371_ShriekOfGhosts reply_3|"I want to quit."]
