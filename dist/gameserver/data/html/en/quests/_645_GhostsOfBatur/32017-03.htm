We can help the Spiteful Souls in the *Crypts of Disgrace* to become "saved" before they travel elsewhere. When you defeat the Spiteful Souls, you will see some *Cursed Grave Accessories* which they used to manifest their physical power. Please these accessories them and bring them to me.

By my current estimate, I need about *180* of them. If you get me that many, I think I can do the rest.
