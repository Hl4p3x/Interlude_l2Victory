!Grand Master Oltran:

Her anger towards Gran Kain and Einhasad for a time turned Shilen into a pure and perfect being. That is, she became the literal incarnation of destruction.

As she achieved the purest form of fury, her benevolence and austerity left her completely. Her perfect wrath is the source of those evil creatures.

They are sealed away now, and I don't know what their current condition is, but their very existence proves that she has become a goddess of destruction!

We worshippers of Shilen teach our children that she is our mother, therefore we must calm her wrath.
