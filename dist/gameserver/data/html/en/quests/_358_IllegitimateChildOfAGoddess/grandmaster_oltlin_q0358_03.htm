!Grand Master Oltran:

Ah, yes, the bitter ramblings of an old man. As you approach true enlightenment, the shadows grow darker. Among those who pursue glory, some work diligently against the shadow at every opportunity.

At the same time, they must know that their efforts are as futile as covering up the sky with your hand. Of course, I don't need to explain this to you. The gods created us in their own imperfect image.

Perfect beings' only creations are contrivances. As the perfect circle has no edge... perfect hatred only produces monsters.
