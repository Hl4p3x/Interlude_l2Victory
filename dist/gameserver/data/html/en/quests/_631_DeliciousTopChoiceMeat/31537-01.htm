!Beast Herder Tunatun:

The meat of wild beasts is renowned for its succulence! From the clean taste of Kookaburra to the gamy taste of cougar, and Buffalo, with it's strong, musky taste...

Unfortunately, there's no one left to raise and slaughter them... As they mature, they become ever more menacing and ferocious!

None of us dare go near them!
