You'll really do it? I knew today was a good day. I'll tell you about the Lienrik.

The Lienrik dwells near the *Rest Area of the Animals*. There's the Lienrik and the Lienrik Lad. One has a range attack and one spews poison up close.

Both have the *Lienrik Egg*. That's where the fun begins: The egg determines gender, with the females being the most valuable.

I can't pay money for one, but I'll definitely offer a reward. Bring back as many as you can.

I might even let you keep one~
