!Pet Manager Rood:

Are you still here? Go to the *Rest Area of the Animals* and bring back a *Lienrik Egg* or a *Lienrik Lad Egg*. I'll make it worth your while, I promise you that. Or are you just going to give up?

[Quest _352_HelpRoodRaiseANewPet reply_2|Say that you will get the egg.]

[Quest _352_HelpRoodRaiseANewPet reply_3|Say you want to quit.]
