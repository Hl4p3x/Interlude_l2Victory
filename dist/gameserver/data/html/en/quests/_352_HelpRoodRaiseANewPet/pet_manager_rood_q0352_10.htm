!Pet Manager Rood:

Ready to do this? Today is a lucky day for both of us! Let me repeat what I told you earlier about Lienrik.

Both Lienrik and Lienrik Lads can be found in the *Rest Area of the Animals*. Approach both carefully, as once can spew poison from a great distance.

Both kinds lay *eggs*, but finding a female Lienrik is very rare.

Well, if you can do this for me, I'll make it worth your while -- I promise!

Even bringing back one would make my day!
