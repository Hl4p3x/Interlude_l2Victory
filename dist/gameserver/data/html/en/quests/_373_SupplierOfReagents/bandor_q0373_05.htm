Welcome back! Come in! You're just in time. Grand Magister Arkenias has been asking for his order... I was able to put him off for a few days. Have you found the reagents I need? Bring them and I'll give you some ingredients, recipes or other items that you'll find useful.

[Quest _373_SupplierOfReagents reply_2|"Here are the reagents you requested."]

[Quest _373_SupplierOfReagents reply_4|"Tell me about the memo."]

[Quest _373_SupplierOfReagents reply_5|"I quit."]
