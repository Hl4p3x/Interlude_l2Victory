!Magic Trader Wesley:

Formulas explain which ingredients and the amounts you will need in order to create a particular reagent. All formulas explain how many ingredients and how many catalysts should be added.

For example, in order to create Dracoplasm, ten units of Wyrm's Blood and one Blood Root should be mixed.

I wrote down a list of the required reagents and mixing formulas on the *memo* and attached it on the urn. Please refer to it often.

Well, my dear new partner... I'll be counting on you.
