The lowest temperature you can set is 1 degree, also called "Salamander." This is the safest choice. Although the success rate for mixing is 100%, the amount of reagent produced will be the smallest.

The medium temperature setting is 2 degrees, also called "Ifrit." You run a risk of melting your ingredients at this temperature. This setting will yield a larger amount of reagent.

The highest temperature setting is 3 degrees, also known as "Phoenix." Although ingredients often melt at this setting, if successful, you will obtain the greatest amount of reagent.
