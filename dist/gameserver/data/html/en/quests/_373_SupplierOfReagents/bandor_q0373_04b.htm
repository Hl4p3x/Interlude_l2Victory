!Magic Trader Wesley:

First you must activate the jar. Do this by inserting a mixing stone into the niche on the side of the jar. Once activated, you can start using the jar immediately. You must gather the correct quantity and types of ingredients and catalysts and put them into it.

Remember, once you place ingredients into the jar, you cannot take them out again. So, be careful! You can waste your hard-won ingredients with a single mistake... Before you start mixing, make sure that you have the proper amount of all the necessary ingredients.

Now, I'll tell you how to set the temperature of the jar.
