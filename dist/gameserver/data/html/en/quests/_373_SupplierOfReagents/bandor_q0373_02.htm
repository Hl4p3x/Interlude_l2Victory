!Magic Trader Wesley:

I buy ingredients from adventurers like you, create various reagents from them and then sell them to the Mystics of the Ivory Tower. Although a mere merchant, I am proud of my association with the Mystics.

Many common ingredients such as Jade and Dragon's Tooth are readily available, as many adventurers bring them to me. But there are other ingredients that are much more rare. I need a new regular supplier of these ingredients... Would you like to be that person?
