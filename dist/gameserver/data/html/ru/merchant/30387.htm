!Wharf Manager Clancy:

Welcome. Did you come here to embark on a boat trip? Gludin is going to have many passenger liners now. Can you believe it? A regular passenger liner from Elmore Kingdom which once was our our enemy...!  Although you can't feel the passion or liveliness of the past here, I am hopeful that now I see that some things seem to be getting better.

Oh, and there's no fee for the boat ride to Rune Castle Town in Elmore territory since we are test marketing this new route.

Do you want a ticket for transport?
