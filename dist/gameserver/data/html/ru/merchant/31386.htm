!Trader Violet:

Hi there! You must be an adventurer! Why else would you be in such a remote, dangerous place? Especially at night, with all the scary evil spirits about!

Do you want to trade? You must really be hard up! This is a small village, so I don't carry any high quality items. Look around, maybe you'll find something useful.
