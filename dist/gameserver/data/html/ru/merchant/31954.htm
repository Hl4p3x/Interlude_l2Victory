!Pet Manager Saroyan:

Are you interested in a pet? Let's see... Oh, forgive my staring! Sorry. I can't resist examining my customers' faces.

I know it seems peculiar... It's just that many people want pets these days, but too often these animals wind up abused or abandoned. So I must scrutinize people before I feel comfortable with selling them a pet. No offence.
